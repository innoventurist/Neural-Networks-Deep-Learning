<h2><strong><em> About </em></strong></h2>

<p>Deep Learning, also referred to as Neural Networks, can be implemented into various types of applications such as real estate, online advertising, image, audio,
 machine translation and autonomous driving. Methods and architectures used in these industries include convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural
 networks (RNN), long short term memory (LSTM), dropout, batch norm, etc. Overall, the goal is for AI to be as close to the capabilities of a human based off
 the workings of the brain. </p>

<p>This section specifically looks at having a full understanding of Deep Learning, how it works and major technology current trends. </p>
